Maps are similar to structs. 
Maps are like dictionaries in python.

Both they keys and values all have to be the same type

Map = {
    All keys must be the same type
    Use to represent a collection of related properties.
    All values must be the same type.
    Don't need to know all the keys at compile time.
    Keys are indexed we can iterate over them.
    Reference type!
}

Struct = {
    Values can be of different type.
    You need to know all the different fields at compile time. 
    Keys don't support indexing.
    Use to reprecent a thing with lots of differenct properties. 
    Value Type!
}

bool = true/false.
string = Sequence of characters.
int = integer.

:= only used when defining a new variable

Variables can be initialized outside of the function they are used in so long as they are defined there also.

Every function that returns a value must indicate what type of value it is returning.

Array = Fixed length list of things. 
Slice = An array that can grow or shrink.

GO is not an OO programming language.

Slices are 0 indexed
fruits = "apple" "banana" "grapes"
fruits[0] = "apple"
fruits[1] = "banana"
fruits[startindexIncluding : upToNotIncluding]
fruits[0:2] = "apple" "banana"


To test a GO program create a file with the name + _test.go
